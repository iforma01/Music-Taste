# Music Taste

This is a web application that uses the Spotify Web API. The purpose is to compare Spotify libraries between two people (by comparing their saved albums). I built this to gain more experience with backend web development (therefore, certain design choices were made because of the learning opportunity that they provided). It is still a work-in-progress and may be improved in the future.

# What It Does
Person 1 logs in to their Spotify account. The website displays their top played artists and collects data on their saved albums, temporarily storing them in local storage. Then Person 2 logs in to their Spotify account. The website displays their top played artists and then compares their saved albums with the saved albums of Person 1. Finally, the similarity between the two users' libraries is displayed as a percentage, and a list of all of their albums in common is displayed.
